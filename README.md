# A slight modification of Chess-Coding-Adventure

This repository is almost entirely a copy of SebLague/Chess-Coding-Adventure:Chess-V2-UCI, and is mainly intended to allow my own
primitve to chess-bot to compete at lichess using the uci interface. A number of features in the original repo has been commented out.
